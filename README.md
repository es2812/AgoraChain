# AgoraChain

A blockchain voting system based on liquid democracy developed with Hyperledger Composer

## Running the project

As of this moment, this project runs on hyperledger fabric, using the set of `composer-cli` commands for deployment and with an in-development angular API as an easier way to operate over the network with an identity.

The recommended way of running the project is:

1. Follow the [Installing the development environment tutorial](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/development-tools.html) in the Hyperledger Composer website. 
2. Run `npm install -g passport-github`
3. [`start.sh`](https://github.com/es2812/AgoraChain/tree/master/composer-env/agora-network/dist/start.sh) installs and starts the `.bna` file of the specified version (1.0.1 recommended) and creates some sample participants and cards, starting the REST server in `localhost:3000`.
4. Navigate to the [`angular-api/AgoraChain`](https://github.com/es2812/AgoraChain/tree/master/angular-api/AgoraChain/) folder and execute the command `npm start` to deploy the Angular API (usually on `localhost:4200`).
5. The Angular API requires you to Log In with Github (this might be changed at some point to a more universal OAuth service) to allow you access to the identity manager.
6. Within the identity manager you can import one of the cards created in step 2, which correspond to each of the participants currently existing in the network. Each identity will give you a set of allowed actions over the network.

You can undeploy and kill the network with the [`stop.sh`](https://github.com/es2812/AgoraChain/tree/master/composer-env/agora-network/dist/stop.sh) script and kill the REST and Angular servers simply using Ctrl+C on the respective terminals.

## Proposal

### Principles of the system

After reviewing proposals on both Blockchain systems [\[1\]](#References) for traditional elections and proposals of Liquid Democracy implementations [\[2\]](#References), a set of principles for the system has been comprised, and are as follows:

1. Citizens can vote either directly or through representation.
2. Any citizen can declare themselves a "politician", and a citizen can set that politician as their representation. Each citizen can only have one representative at one given point.
3. Votes issued directly by citizens are **anonymous**, except for that citizen.
4. Votes issued by politicians are **public** to everyone in the network.
5. Representation can be nulled at any point, including automatic nulling based on a politician's choice in any given election.
6. Citizens and politicians can change their vote until election is closed.
7. Citizens with representation can still vote directly, without that nulling the representation.

### System modelling

This system will be implemented using a Blockchain, developed with Hyperledger Composer. Hyperledger allows permissioned blockchains, and Composer allows for easy modelling, deployment and usage of the system.

Hyperledger Composer's modelling allows for three types of building blocks: participants, assets and transactions.

The way Hyperledger Composer operates is with two blockchains, the **ledger**, which contains all transactions submitted and approved, and the **state database** which contains the current state of assets and participants.

#### Participants

Members of the blockchain. They may own assets and submit transactions. Each participant in the network has an *Identity*, defined as a digital certificate and a private key.

- **Citizens**: These participants can issue anonymous votes and delegate on politicians.
- **Politicians**: These participants can be delegated on by citizens, and can issue public votes. The way a member of the blockchain declares himself a politician requires the issuing of a new identity, and will be done outside the blockchain itself (but still through the API).
- **Legislators**: These participants can create, open, and close elections.

#### Assets

These objects represent the (intangible) goods used in the system.

- **Election**: This asset represents a voting process, it's owned by one legislator.
- **Vote**: This asset represents a vote, it's issued by a citizen or politician, pointing to the voter in the latter case.
- **Envelope**: This asset represents an identified "envelope" that holds the secret vote by the citizen. Access to it will be restricted.
- **Restriction**: This asset represents the restriction in the representation coming from a citizen.

#### Transactions

The mechanism by which Participants interact with Assets.

- Citizen transactions:

  - **Trust**: Creates a Representation asset between the Citizen and a Politician.
  - **NullTrust**: Deletes the Representation asset between the Citizen and his current representative.
  - **AddRestriction**: Adds a restriction to the citizen's representation.
  - **RemoveRestriction**: Deletes a restriction to the citizen's representation.
  - **PrepareEnvelope**: Prepares an identified Envelope that will allow the Citizen to vote anonymously.
  - **Anonymous vote**: Creates or modifies (if the citizen has already voted) the Vote asset by the Citizen, related to an Election asset.

- Politician transactions:

  - **Public vote**: Creates or modifies (if the politician has already voted) the Vote by the Politician, related to an Election asset.

- Legislator transactions:

  - **Create elections**: Creates an Election asset.
  - **Open elections**: Allows votes on an Election asset.
  - **Close elections**: Stops allowing votes on an Election asset.

#### Smart contracts

Smart contracts are defined in Hyperledger Composer as **Transaction Functions**, and will be invoked on a transaction. We define the following Transaction Functions in the system:

- On **close elections**, count the number of votes in the ledger and change the state of the asset to the result. An important aspect is to count **public votes** as the number of citizens that politician represents right now *unless* the citizen has issued their own vote in that election.
- On **public vote**, ensure the restrictions of the **Representation** asset for each of the represented citizens are respected, if they're not, null **Representation**.

#### Privacy concerns

Since it's an important principle of our system, there was a need to implement some levels of privacy in the *Anonymous vote* transaction and the *Vote* asset, which must keep a secret who the voter was, while still keeping the rest of the asset and transaction's content public.

It was decided to implement a "double envelope" scheme, used in traditional mail voting. Thus we create the asset **Envelope**. This asset keeps track of the voter, election, and points to a **Vote** asset.

Said **Vote** asset doesn't have a public voter set for Citizens (it does for Politicians), and so it acts as the inner, secret, envelope which contains the choice of the Citizen.

Restrictions must be set for the **Envelope** asset to allow its access and utilization only to the citizen that issued it.
